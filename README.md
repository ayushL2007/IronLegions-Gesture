## Real-Time Sign Language to Text Translation

---

## 🌍 The Problem

Communication between sign language users and non-signers remains a major accessibility challenge in everyday digital interactions. Existing solutions typically suffer from one or more of the following limitations:

* Require **specialized hardware** which most don't have access to/
* Depend on **cloud-based inference**, introducing latency and concerning privacy risks
* Perform poorly in **real-world environments** with background clutter and lighting variations
* Lack **accessibility tools** such as speech output
* Are **not scalable**, expensive to deploy, or difficult to integrate

As a result, sign language users are often excluded from seamless communication in web-based systems.

There is a strong need for a **lightweight, real-time, privacy-preserving, and accurate sign language translation system** that runs directly in the browser and works reliably across devices.

---

## 💡 Our Solution – Signetic

**Signetic** is a fully responsive **browser-based real-time ASL fingerspelling to text translator** that runs **entirely on the client side**.

Instead of relying on cloud APIs or black-box classifiers, Signetic uses a **pose-based, explainable computer vision pipeline** that converts hand gestures into readable text with minimal latency.

### Core Principles

* 🧠 **Pose-based ML** instead of raw image classification
* 🔐 **Zero backend** – complete user privacy
* ⚡ **Low latency** via WebGL-accelerated inference
* ♿ **Accessibility-first** with speech output
* 🧩 **Can be used by anyone instantly , as it comes with no hardware restrictions and is a fast single page web application
* ➕ **Added features like Clear all, backspace, and text to speech for more accessibility

## 🧩 Core Technical Architecture (Detailed)

### 1️⃣ Computer Vision Layer – YOLOv8 Hand Detection

Signetic uses a **custom-trained YOLOv8 model (trained through Duality AI )** to detect hand presence in real time.

#### What YOLOv8 Does

* Detects whether a hand is present in the frame
* Produces a **stable bounding box** around the hand
* Outputs a **confidence score** to filter false detections

#### Why YOLOv8 Is Necessary

* Prevents MediaPipe from hallucinating landmarks when no hand exists
* Filters background noise before pose estimation
* Stabilizes the UI overlay (green bounding box)
* Improves robustness in cluttered or dynamic scenes

YOLOv8 acts as a **spatial gatekeeper** for the entire pipeline.

## 🤖 YOLOv8 + Duality AI (Synthetic Data Training)

The YOLOv8 model used in Signetic is **custom-trained**

### Why Custom Training Was Required

Generic hand detectors often fail due to:

* Limited pose diversity
* Poor generalization to camera angles
* Sensitivity to lighting and occlusion

To overcome this, YOLOv8 was trained using **Duality AI synthetic data**.

### What Is Duality AI?

**Duality AI** provides physics-accurate synthetic environments that enable:

* Controlled camera viewpoints
* Diverse hand orientations
* Variable lighting and backgrounds
* Perfect ground-truth annotations

### How Duality AI Is Used in Signetic

* Synthetic hand scenes are generated using Duality AI
* These scenes are used to train YOLOv8 for hand localization
* The resulting model generalizes better to real-world webcam input

### Why Synthetic Data Matters

| Real-World Data   | Synthetic Data (Duality AI) |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Limited diversity | Infinite pose variation     |
| Annotation noise  | Perfect labels              |
| Privacy concerns  | Privacy-safe                |
| Expensive         | Scalable                    |

Synthetic data significantly improves **robustness and generalization**, which is critical for browser-based computer vision systems.

### 2️⃣ Pose Estimation Layer – Google MediaPipe Hands

Once a hand is detected, Signetic uses **MediaPipe Hands** to extract pose information.

* Extracts **21 normalized 3D landmarks** per hand
* Tracks finger joints, tips, palm center, and orientation
* GPU-accelerated using **WASM + WebGL**

#### Why Pose-Based ML Over Image-Based ML

* Computationally efficient
* Robust to lighting and background changes
* Works consistently across different users

---

### 3️⃣ Geometric Feature Engineering (Key Innovation)

Instead of using a black-box neural classifier, Signetic computes **explicit geometric features** from landmarks:

* Finger extension states
* Joint-to-joint distances
* Thumb relative positioning
* Inter-finger gaps
* Hand orientation vectors
* Vertical / horizontal / inverted pose detection

This approach makes the system:

* Deterministic
* Debuggable
* Transparent
* Improvable 


---

### 4️⃣ Gesture Classification Logic

Each ASL alphabet is identified using **rule-based geometric constraints**:

for example:
* **A / S/ E** → Thumb placement along other fingers
* **G / H** → Horizontal index alignment
* **R** → Crossed index and middle fingers
* **B/F/D** → Position of fingers in a palm

This avoids heavy training and ensures consistent output along with efficiency

---

### 5️⃣ Temporal Stabilization Engine

Live video is inherently noisy. Signetic stabilizes predictions using:

* Frame buffers
* Majority voting
* Stable gesture thresholds
* Duplicate character prevention

Only **consistent gestures across multiple frames** are converted into text.

---

## 🗣️ Accessibility Layer

* **Text-to-Speech** using the Web Speech API
* Converts translated text into audible speech
* Enables two-way communication between signers and non-signers

## 🧪 Why Dual-Model Architecture (YOLO + MediaPipe)?

| Challenge        | Single Model      | Signetic Dual-Model        |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| False positives  | High              | Reduced via YOLO filtering |
| Background noise | Affects landmarks | Isolated hand ROI          |
| Visual stability | Jittery           | Frozen bounding logic      |
| Accuracy         | Inconsistent      | Confidence-aware pipeline  |

This dual-model design significantly improves **real-world reliability**.
